What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Git automatically adds a hidden folder called '.git' to convert your folder to a git repository.
- We need to do this in order to track your file commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- Working Directory is untracked by Git.
- Staging area is ready for commit.
- You can reset files in a staging area by using reset command. Eg git reset lesson_2_reflections.text
- Staging area can be used to commit logical group of codes in separately.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-git diff: Shows the difference between your working directory and staging directory
-git diff --staged: Shows the difference between your staging directory and git repository
-git diff commitID1 commitID2: Shows the difference between two committed IDS in GIT repo
Steps:
a) Use diff to see your changes.
b) Choose which files to include
c) Stage them using: git add fileName
d) Commit them using: git commit
