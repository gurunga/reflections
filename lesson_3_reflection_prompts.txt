When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- If multiple collaborators are working on a same project.
- Storing all your work on a single local hard disk might risk losing it due to disk failure.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- To avoid conflict with my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Forks: A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
  Clones: A clone is simply a copy of a repository.
  Branches: A branch is something that is within a repository. Conceptually, it represents a thread of development.
