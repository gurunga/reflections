When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- If multiple collaborators are working on a same project.
- Storing all your work on a single local hard disk might risk losing it due to disk failure.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- To avoid conflict with my local repository.
